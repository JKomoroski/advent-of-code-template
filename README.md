# Advent of Code
---

A template for [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025) using Java 25 - hopefully using only the standard library.

### Requirements
- Java 25
- maven

### How To
- Build with `./mvnw clean install`
- Run with`java -jar target/aoc-2025-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar 02`
  - Where `02` is a part of the name of the class you want to run
  - On first run it will create the `inputs` tree
- Update your test data to `inputs/day-0x/test.txt`
- Update your input data to `./inputs/day-0x/in.txt`
